# Inverted-Index-using-Map-Reduce

INTRODUCTION
------------
This project creates an Inverted Index of words occurring in a set of English books. A collection of 3,036 English books written by 142 authors is used. This collection is a small subset of the Project Gutenberg corpus that was further cleaned for the purpose of this assignmet. These books are placed in a bucket on Google cloud storage and the Hadoop job reads the input from this bucket and creates an inverted index.

STEPS
-----
1. Establish an account on the Google Cloud Platform.
2. Set up and configure a Hadoop Cluster using the Dataproc API.
3. Upload the corpus of English Textbooks into the bucket on the Google Cloud Storage.
4. Write a Map-Reduce job to create an inverted index of this corpus.
